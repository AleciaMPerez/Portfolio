# Portfolio

## Description

I created my Portfolio so that potential employers can review my information in a single location. I learned how to set up contact links so that people can email me, call me, and view my GitHub profile. I also learned how flexbox works and how to utilize it so that images and text appear appropriately. Lastly, I learned how to make text appear in place of a picture. 

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

My Portfolio allows people to contact me directly via phone, email, and to view my GitHub profile, simply by selecting the links in the CONTACT ME section.

My Portfolio also allows people to get to know me via the small About Me section, and My Work section. In my About Me section, you can view pictures of my pets and hover over them to view their name.
